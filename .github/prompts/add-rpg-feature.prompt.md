# Add RPG Feature

I need to add a new feature to the legacy RPG banking system. 

**Before you start:**
1. Read the affected RPG program files completely
2. Review RPG-CONVENTIONS.md for coding standards
3. Review PRODUCT.md for business rules
4. Understand existing patterns in the codebase

**Create a detailed plan that includes:**
1. Which program(s) need modification
2. What procedures/functions will be added or changed
3. Database file changes (if any)
4. Data structure modifications
5. Error handling approach
6. Audit trail considerations
7. Testing scenarios (happy path, error cases, edge cases)

**After I approve the plan, implement the changes following:**
- Free-format RPG syntax only
- Commitment control for all database operations
- Comprehensive error checking with %ERROR()
- Proper audit trail updates (date, time, user)
- Inline comments explaining business logic
- Updated procedure documentation headers
